    <h1> My Mycology findings - here is what I've found</h1>
    <p>I've been foraging mushrooms for around a year. First time I foraged one was in <strong>Hackney Marshes</strong> where I saw a woman picking mushrooms in that grew in a circle. Since then I've found loads more mushrooms</p>
<ul>
  <li>Couliflower Mushroom</li>
  <li>beef steak</li>
  <li>Fly Agaric</li>
  <li>Chicken of the woods</li>
  <li>boletus</li>
</ul>
<p>A website that was very useful was <a href="https://www.wildfooduk.com/">Wild Food UK</a></p>

<p>There are three types of mushrooms:</p>
