    <p>I've been foraging mushrooms for around two years. First time I foraged some was in Hackney Marshes where I saw a woman picking mushrooms that grew in a circle on the grass. I approached to her and told me what they were, when I researched online it seemed she was right. That's when it all begun.
      A few months later I did a day couse with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wildfooduk.com/">Wild Food UK</a> where they taught me the basic of mushrrom foraging.
      Since then, I've been self learning being now able to identify quite a few subspieces of edible and non edible mushrooms.

<p>It's easily to feel overwhelmed when trying to start mycology or mushroom foraging. First thing is to start just
  one mushroom at a time and don't try to learn them all at once. You can focus on learning the characteristics of 
the 3 most common mushrooms in your country on the current season.

Best time to start learning is <strong>now</strong>.
